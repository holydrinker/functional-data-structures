# functional-data-structures
I love object oriented programming, algorithms, data structures, information hiding and so on. I recently fell in love with scala and functional programming, so this project aims to be a forma-mentis training towars FP, and do some practice in Scala.

I had this practical session when I was super noob, so all advices, improvements and bug fixes would be really appreciated :)
